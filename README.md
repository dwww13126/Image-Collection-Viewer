# Image-Collection-Viewer

Project from COMPX222 Web Development where we were to create a PHP based website which provides a user with a randomized grid of images which they can save under their favorites and add information about. Initial project was based on Mars images, however the images used by this assessment have been removed from the university webserver so project has been altered to provide a user with cat images included with the project. Additions and fixes will be made to improve on the project.
